Just go to a fruit tree (apple trees can be found in normal $(l:exploration/biomes#forest)forest$()s, other fruit trees in the $(l:exploration/biomes#fruit_forest)Fruit Forest$() biome), and right click on one of the leaves that contains a fruit.  The fruit will pop off, ready for eating!  Eventually, a new fruit will grow back in its place on the leaves."

      "text": "You can get maple syrup from $(l:exploration/trees#maple_tree)maple tree$()s by right clicking on the slit in their trunk with a glass bottle while it has syrup; the syrup will 'grow' back.  Drinking maple syrup can give you food points, saturation and a short boost of speed."
